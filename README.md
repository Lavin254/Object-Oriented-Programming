Overview 🧑‍💻
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on objects, which can contain data and methods. This repository demonstrates how to implement OOP concepts such as:

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Through examples and clear code, you’ll learn how to use Dart to structure your applications efficiently and effectively

Key Concepts 📚
Here are the OOP principles you'll explore in this repository:

Encapsulation: Protecting data by using private variables and controlled access through getters and setters.
Inheritance: Reusing and extending code functionality via a parent-child class relationship.
Polymorphism: Overriding methods to create multiple behaviors in derived classes.
Abstraction: Designing abstract classes and methods for high-level architecture.
